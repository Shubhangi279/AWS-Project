## 📌 What is Linux?

Linux is an **open-source operating system** based on the Unix architecture.
It manages hardware resources and provides services to applications, just like Windows or macOS — but it is **free, secure, and highly customizable**.

Linux is widely used in:

* Servers and Cloud Computing ☁️
* Cybersecurity & Ethical Hacking 🔐
* Software Development 💻
* Embedded Systems & IoT 📡
* Supercomputers 🚀

## 📌 Features of Linux

✅ **Open Source** – Source code is freely available and can be modified.
✅ **Multiuser** – Multiple users can work simultaneously.
✅ **Multitasking** – Run multiple processes at the same time.
✅ **Highly Secure** – Strong permission and authentication system.
✅ **Portable** – Runs on various hardware platforms.
✅ **Stable & Reliable** – Rarely crashes; ideal for servers.
✅ **Customizable** – Users can modify the system as needed.

## 📌 Linux Architecture

Linux follows a layered architecture:

```
+---------------------------+
|        Applications       |
+---------------------------+
|          Shell            |
+---------------------------+
|          Kernel           |
+---------------------------+
|        Hardware           |
+---------------------------+
```

### 🔹 Kernel

The **core of Linux**, responsible for:

* Memory Management
* Process Management
* Device Drivers
* File System Handling

### 🔹 Shell

Acts as an interface between the **user and the kernel**.
Example shells: `bash`, `sh`, `zsh`.

## 📌 Basic Linux Commands

| Command | Description                |
| ------- | -------------------------- |
| `ls`    | List files and directories |
| `cd`    | Change directory           |
| `pwd`   | Show current directory     |
| `mkdir` | Create new directory       |
| `touch` | Create empty file          |
| `rm`    | Delete file                |
| `cp`    | Copy file                  |
| `mv`    | Move/Rename file           |
| `chmod` | Change permissions         |
| `man`   | Help manual for commands   |

## 📌 File Permissions in Linux

Linux uses a permission model:

```
r = read (4)
w = write (2)
x = execute (1)
```

Example:

```
chmod 755 file.sh
```

Meaning:

* Owner → Read, Write, Execute
* Others → Read, Execute
